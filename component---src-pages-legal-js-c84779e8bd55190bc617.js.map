How do we gather Information</h3>\n<h4>2.1 Information is gathered in 2 ways:</h4>\n<p>(1) indirectly (for example, through our website’s technology or use of an App); and</p>\n\n<p>(2) directly (for example, when you provide information on various pages of the website or when you return any completed form).</p>\n\n<p>2.2 We collect information directly from you when you sign up to our services or through the use of cookies.

Find out more about the use of cookies on http://www.cookiecentral.com.</p>\n\n<p>3.2 We use the following types of cookie:</p>\n\n<p>(1a) Personal Analytics cookies that anonymously remember your computer or mobile device when you visit our website. They keep track of browsing patterns and build up a profile of how our readers use the website. We might use that information to target advertisements to you on our and other websites.</p>\n\n<p>(1b) Users Analytics cookies. biscaypla.in uses cookies to run tests and analyze the customer’s website visitor data. The cookies keep track of the variation a visitor has viewed and serve the same variation to the visitor consistently, track goals completed by a visitor, and determine whether a user is part of a test.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Service cookies that help us to make our website work as efficiently as possible; remember your registration and login details; remember your settings preferences; and meter the number of pages you view for the purpose of administering subscriptions to Magazines and website.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Third party advertising and analytics cookies, which are placed by or on behalf of independent advertisers who are advertising on our site. These cookies may be placed within the advertisement and elsewhere on our site. They are anonymous – they cannot identify individuals. They are used for statistical analysis by allowing the advertiser to count how many people have seen their advertisement or have seen it more than once. They might also allow the advertiser to tailor advertising to you when you visit other websites.</p>\n\n<p>3.3 We have no access to third party cookies and third party organisations have no access to ours.
